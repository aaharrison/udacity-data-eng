# Project 2: Data modeling with Apache Cassandra

### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

### Project Description

The project requires..

* Process the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to create a denormalized dataset
* Model the data tables keeping in mind the queries you need to run
* Load the data into tables you create in Apache Cassandra and run your queries
